<h1>Advantages and disadvantages of mobile computing</h1>
<hr/>
<p>Advantages:

    1- Increase in Productivity- Mobile devices can be used out in the field of various companies, therefore reducing the time and cost for clients and themselves.
    
    2- Entertainment- Mobile devices can be used for entertainment purposes, for personal and even for presentations to people and clients.
    
    3- Portability- this would be one of the main advantages of mobile computing, you are not restricted to one location in order for you to get jobs done or even access email on the go
    
    4- Cloud Computing- This service is available for saving documents on a online server and being able to access them anytime and anywhere when you have a connection to the internet and can access these files on several mobile devices or even PCs at home.</p> 
    
    <p>Disadvantages:
    
    1- Quality of connectivity- as one of the disadvantages, mobile devices will need either WiFi connectivity or mobile network connectivity such as GPRS, 3G and in some countries even 4G connectivity  that is why this is a disadvantage because if you are not near any of these connections your access to the internet is very limited.
    
    2- Security concerns- Mobile VPNs are unsafe to connect to, and also syncing devices might also lead to security concerns. accessing a WiFi network can also be risky because WPA and WEP security can be bypassed easily.
    
    3- Power Consumption- due to the use of batteries in these devices, these do not tend to last long, if in a situation where there is  no source of power for charging then that will certainly be a let down.</p>
